# Gmail-SMTP-Server
The aim of this project is to create a simple mail client that sends an email to any receiver of emails. In other words, the client will need to establish a TCP connection with a mail server (e.g., Gmail), and use the SMTP protocol to dialog with the mail server. The client will send an email to anyone who wants to use an already hard-coded email "eliasprojectnetwork@gmail.com," then the TCP connection to the mail server will be closed after the submission is successful.
